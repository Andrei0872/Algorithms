Practicing algorithms using JavaScript/PHP/C++
 ---
 
### Welcome !

 Here you can visualize some of the algorithms I enjoyed really much solving. I personally think that practicing algorithm solving really increases your ability to solve **real** problems that you will encounter farther in your projects. I'm not much of an expert __yet__, but I've gone through these kind of situations, even though it's not much since I've started learning web development.
 
 As a result, feel free to take  a look over these algorithms and I'd be very thankful if you can find and share some improvements.
 
 **Happy coding!**
